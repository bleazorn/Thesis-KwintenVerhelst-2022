This is the code for the thesis "A nanopass compiler for CHERI-RISC-V"

Each Milestone map contains a previous version of the compiler.
Current version: 4 in the map Milestone4.


Makefile commands:

make    
	Will create an assembly and elf file for the example.txt program
	
make <file>.S
	Compiles the program in an assembly file. With program in <file>.txt with <file> pattern matched

make <file>.elf
	Will create an assembly file and elf file for program in <file>.txt with <file> pattern matched

make <file>.elf MEmulator="<Location of emulator>"
	Will create an assembly file and elf file for program in <file>.txt with <file> pattern matched
	And run it through an emulator on location <Location of emulator>.

	it's run with ~/$(MEmulator) command.
	
make <file>.elf MEmulator="<Location of emulator>" MVerbose="on"
	Will create an assembly file and elf file for program in <file>.txt with <file> pattern matched
	And run it through an emulator on location <Location of emulator> in verbose mode.

make generate
	Creates the binaries for all the milestones.
	Will make the compiling faster.

make cleanbin
	deletes the binaries for the milestones.

make cleanS
	Deletes all .S files in the dir of the makefile.

make cleanE
	Deletes all .elf files in the dir of the makefile.

make cleanFiles
	Deletes all .S and .elf files in the dir of the makefile.

make cleanTest
	Used in the tester.rkt file

make clean
	Deletes all .S and .elf files in the dir of the makefile and the binaries from the milestones.


tester.rkt
	Racket file that contains methods to test programs. Uses tester.sh
	To use it, you need to change the variable emulatorLoc to the location of your emulator.


Builder is used to make elf files

CCreateToken lr lr 
	1 creates a normal standalone living lifetime token.
	2 lifetimes can be created as sublifetimes of existing lifetimes by
		providing a fraction of the desired parent lifetime

CKillToken lr lr 
	lifetime token can be irreversibly killed

CUnlockToken r r r
	clears the child id field on the parent token. The parent token can
then be killed or receive a new sublifetime

CSplitLT lr lr 
	lifetime tokens to have a fraction f and be split using

CMergeLT lr lr lr 
	This instruction consumes both fractions to create
		the same lifetime token

CBorrowImmut br br lr
	A lifetime token can be used to borrow a capability

CBorrowMut br br lr 
	A lifetime token can be used to borrow a capability

CRetrieveIndex br ir lr

CGetLinear rd cs1
	gets linear bit

CMakeLinear cd cs1
	copies the capability in cs1 to cd and sets its linear
		bit	

CSplitCap cd cs1 rs2
	splits the capability in cs1 in two with the boundaries
		of both parts determined by the integer offset specified in cs2

CMergeCap cd cs1 cs2
	requires two capabilities pointing to contiguous memory sections in its source registers and joins
	them together to form a single capability that points to the entire memory section
